                <p>I'm putting this blog together to explore a want to share ideas and an incipient interest writing. I'm looking forward to sharing some (somewhat) personal thoughts, ideas, and experiences. </p>

                    To live is to learn.This may come across as hypocritical, or even corny, but it’s the truth. We are always faced with novel sets of challenges with which we much grapple, learn from, and develop through — it ain’t always pretty. For me, a good reminder of this fact is the ICU monitor. The peaks and troughs on its screen represent, for me, the highs and lows of life — which are essential to a person’s being alive. When the person dies, these lines flatten out as If to say, “if life is going to dull and monochromatic, you might as well be dead”

                   Nothing, however, is simple in life, and sharing experiences is essential if we are to make any progress. With this blog I want to share what I gather from experience, observation,  conversations with other people etc. I hope to be able to talk about some of those topics that people just gloss over — which are nonetheless essential &mdash;  with spirituality being the crux.

                    As “young and wild and free” as we are, I’ve noticed that , on occasion, we are able to have profound conversations, and ponder the state of the world: human health, wealth, the awful mess that is our country, wars, etc. We even talk about how we are going to change things if we are given the opportunity. I would like  to capture some of those ideas and convos on this blog as well.

                <h5>Contributors</h5>
                <p>Alas! I’m not the guy with all the lessons or solutions. I’m just the guy who wants draw insight, and share it. It would be nice to have contributors; that is why there’s a whole section dedicated	to contributors. As the saying goes “if you want to fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go with people” ( I heard this in an MTN advert). </p>
